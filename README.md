# Florian Mattana

GPU Kernel Engineer C/C++ | CUDA | Nsight Compute

## What I do

I implement and optimize GPU kernels in CUDA from scratch — from naive GEMM to Flash Attention — with systematic profiling at every step. Every kernel is benchmarked against production libraries like cuBLAS, with full Nsight Compute analysis.

## Current project

**[cuda-kernels](https://github.com/florianmattana/cuda-kernels)** — CUDA kernels from scratch: GEMM, reduction, prefix scan, softmax, Flash Attention. Each kernel profiled end-to-end with Nsight Compute.
